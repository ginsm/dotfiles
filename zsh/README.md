# dotfiles

These are my personal dotfiles, configurations, and scripts. I primarily use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about) nowadays so there isn't much in the way of [DE](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/desktop_environment) configurations.

The strategy for organization and installation is borrowed from Andrew Burgress; here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oXy6ktYs7I) and [article](https://shaky.sh/simple-dotfiles/) that goes into it more.
